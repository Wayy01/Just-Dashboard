# Changelog

Every release of Just Dashboard, newest first.

**This file is generated.** The source is [`backend/internal/selfupdate/changelog.json`](backend/internal/selfupdate/changelog.json), which is the same file the dashboard reads — both the copy compiled into your build and the one it fetches to find out whether a newer version exists. Edit that, then run `scripts/release.sh <version>`.

## 0.6.6 — 1 September 2026

**The process table tells you what owns the work**

The Processes page could rank a short list by CPU or memory and send SIGTERM, but it could not tell whether a row belonged to systemd, PM2, a container, a login or the kernel; its search silently ignored every process below the first 200; and disk pressure had no path back to the process causing it. The live inventory now identifies ownership from the host itself, chooses the resource that needs attention, exposes the counters behind that choice, and puts configuration and safe control beside the process instead of at the end of an SSH session.

### Added

- Live processes identify what owns them — PM2, systemd, a container, a login session, the kernel or nobody managing them
  - The owner comes from the cgroup the kernel assigned, with PM2's own PID list overlaid where cgroups cannot tell its children apart. Search and filters cover owner, user, state, name, command and PID, and the complete inventory supplies the counts in each filter rather than only the rows currently on screen. An unmanaged label is deliberate: it says a process will not come back through a supervisor after it is stopped.
- Automatic focus moves between CPU, memory and disk I/O when the host says the bottleneck moved
  - Blocked tasks, iowait or I/O pressure rank processes by their current disk rate; low available memory or memory pressure ranks resident memory; otherwise CPU stays the useful default. The header says which signal made the choice, and CPU, memory, disk I/O or longest-running can still be pinned by hand. Refresh cadence and the number of returned rows are configurable and remembered on this screen.
- A process opens into its executable, working directory, parent, uptime, threads, file descriptors, disk totals and scheduling priority
  - Working directories and executables link into Files. Administrators can adjust the Linux nice value, and the full safe signal set is available with plain-language names — reload, pause and resume as well as terminate — behind the same confirmation and audit boundary as before. Process environments are deliberately not returned; they routinely hold credentials.
- PM2 can gracefully reload an application and save the current list for its existing startup hook
  - Saving runs pm2 save; it does not install or rewrite PM2's platform-specific boot integration. systemd details now put the effective account, working directory, restart policy, resource limits, current resource use and unit file beside the live journal, with a direct route to the unit file in Files.

### Fixed

- A process search now reaches the whole host instead of searching only the 200 rows already selected
  - Filtering happens before sorting and the response cap, and the page separately reports how many matched, how many exist and whether the answer was truncated. The old page told you to filter to reach the rest, then made that impossible.
- A stale process row cannot signal or reprioritise a different process that reused its PID
  - Every control carries the start time of the process that was on screen. The server re-reads that PID immediately before acting and refuses with a refresh instruction if it now belongs to something else. Disk-rate sampling uses the same identity, so PID reuse cannot appear as an impossible I/O spike either.

## 0.6.5 — 30 August 2026

**A file manager, rather than a directory listing with an editor attached**

The Files page opened at "/", drew the same grey glyph on every row, and answered every click by loading the file into a code editor — which is the right answer for a config file and the wrong one for a picture, a tarball, a video and a two-gigabyte log. It now opens where your work is, shows what each thing is before you open it, finds a file from three letters of its name, and edits pictures without sending them to a laptop and back.

### Added

- One click shows you what a file is — the first lines of a config, the picture itself, what is inside an archive, how big a folder really is
  - Selecting a row asks the server what the thing is rather than loading it: a text file comes back as a trimmed head with line numbers, an image as its dimensions and the picture, a video or an audio file with a player, a PDF rendered, a zip or a tarball as the list of what is inside it without unpacking anything. A folder gets a Measure button — the recursive size the listing has always shown as "—", with the heaviest few children ranked underneath, which is the answer to "what is eating this disk". Opening the file is the deliberate second click. Media is served under a closed allowlist of types, so a page uploaded into a web root is still a download rather than something the browser will run.
- Three views — details, tiles and tree — chosen from one control and remembered
  - Tiles are for directories of images and for folders you would rather hit than aim at: thumbnails are the real files drawn small, in three sizes. The tree is now a view in its own right as well as the rail beside the listing. Sorting, hidden files and tile size moved into one Arrange menu, so the tile view can be sorted too rather than silently losing the ability.
- Files are drawn by what they are: source, data, keys and certificates, archives, media and configuration each get their own icon and colour
  - Roughly two hundred extensions plus the files that have none — Dockerfile, Makefile, authorized_keys, .env, a lockfile — and folders whose name says more than "folder", like .git, node_modules and a web root. It is by category rather than by language on purpose: eight colours is something the eye learns in a directory or two, twenty icons is a legend to memorise. An nginx.conf.bak is still a configuration file, and a symlink keeps its target's icon with a link badge in the corner.
- Find a file by typing three letters of its name — ngxcnf finds nginx.conf
  - Ctrl+P opens a fuzzy finder that ranks a match in the name above one in the folder above it, a run of characters above scattered ones, and a shallow path above a deep one, with the matched letters underlined so the ranking is legible rather than magic. Terms are ANDed, so "app tsx" narrows. It searches the folder you are in and widens to home in one click, skips node_modules and .git, and stops itself on a budget rather than walking a disk for a minute — saying so when it did.
- Type a path instead of clicking to it, with Tab completion
  - Ctrl+L — the browser's own chord for an address bar — turns the breadcrumb into a text field that completes on Tab to the longest common prefix, exactly as a shell does. The separators between crumbs became menus of the folders beside them, so moving from one site's public directory to another's is one click rather than three levels of walking back up.
- The page opens where your work is, with a rail of places to get back to
  - Home rather than "/", which is the one directory on a Linux server where nothing you own lives. The rail lists what the machine says about itself — home, the permitted roots, the account directories, and the handful of paths a server keeps its work in, each checked before it is offered — plus folders you star, which are kept on the server because which directory matters is a fact about the box and should be there from another browser, and the folders you were in recently, which are kept in this browser because they are not.
- Crop, rotate, flip, resize and re-encode a picture in place
  - The alternative was copying it to a laptop, opening something and copying it back — for a favicon forty pixels too wide, on the server whose job is to serve that file. Brightness, contrast and saturation, a format and quality choice for JPEG and WebP, ten steps of undo, and Save over the original or Save as a new name. Nothing needs to be installed on the host, and the saved file keeps the owner and mode it already had.
- The editor grew the things an editor is expected to have
  - Ctrl+S saves, find and replace and go-to-line are the editor's own, and there is now word wrap, a minimap, font size, a formatter, a language override for the files whose extension says nothing, a line and column readout, Save as — which is the cheapest possible backup before editing something that keeps a server up — and a prompt before closing with unsaved changes instead of losing them silently.
- A checksum, on the row, for the file you are looking at
  - sha256, sha1 or md5, computed on the server and copied with a click — the other command people keep a terminal open for.

### Changed

- One click selects and previews; two clicks open
  - The click model every desktop file manager uses. A single click used to open the code editor for anything, which is how a JPEG and a tarball both ended up in front of a text editor that would only refuse them.

## 0.6.4 — 29 August 2026

**Controls that do what the page says they do**

Docker's own accounting said forty-three gigabytes could be reclaimed on this server, and nothing in the dashboard could reclaim any of it. The button under that figure navigated to the image list, whose only control removes dangling images — of which a host that redeploys through compose usually has none — and the build cache, which was forty-one of those gigabytes, had no route in the product at all.

Pulling that thread ran through the proxy and security pages, which had the same shape of problem in a dozen places: a control that reported success and changed nothing, or changed something other than what it said. Deleting a proxy site left a copy the list showed as a second site, so deleting that produced a third called .bak.bak. Choosing an application profile in the firewall form wrote a rule for the wrong end of the connection. Allowlisting your own address in fail2ban lasted until its next restart. Under most of them was an assumption about what a Linux server looks like — that nginx keeps its sites in sites-available, that a machine knows its own public address, that a password file root can read is one nginx can read — each false on a large share of the servers this runs on, and each perfectly true on the one it was written against.

### Added

- The build cache can be emptied — on most servers it is the largest thing Docker is holding
  - BuildKit's cache lives outside the image store, so neither an image prune nor the "prune everything" sweep ever touched it, and no route in the product could. It is its own line in the disk panel with its own button, and it is part of the reclaim sweep. Emptying it costs a slower next build and nothing else.
- A disk panel on the Docker images tab: where the space went, split into images, build cache, containers and volumes
  - The `docker system df` view, which is the first thing anybody runs on a server that has filled up. Every figure in it was already being computed and none of it was on screen. Each line says what is reclaimable and carries the button for it — except volumes, which are the one line here that is data rather than a copy of something fetchable, and are still removed one at a time from their own tab.
- Buttons for removing stopped containers and unused networks, which had routes and no way to press them
  - Both endpoints have existed since their tabs did and nothing ever called either, so clearing up meant doing it one row at a time. An unused network also holds a subnet out of the pool, which is what makes a later `compose up` fail to find one.
- The warning about an uncapped log file now has a button that caps it
  - It described a fix the dashboard could perform and did not offer. Docker cannot change a log driver on a running container, so it rebuilds it with a 10 MB limit over three files — the same bargain the restart-policy fix makes, and the dialog says so.

### Fixed

- Reclaiming Docker disk now reclaims it, from the health finding, the Docker page and the new disk panel alike
  - The "Reclaim it" button under the health finding used to navigate to the image list rather than reclaim anything, and the prune it sent you to removes only dangling images — so on a server whose images all carry tags, every route to reclaiming disk freed nothing while the page promised tens of gigabytes. All three entry points now run the same sweep, and it is the one the figure describes: every image no container is using, plus the whole build cache, and never a volume.
- Reclaimable figures now match what a prune actually frees, rather than over-reporting by every shared layer
  - An unused image whose layers also belong to a running one frees almost nothing when it goes — python:3.11-slim measures 189 MB and gives back 2. The old sum counted the full size of everything unused, so the promise was always larger than the result. Both figures are now Docker's own, and a test drives a real daemon to keep them that way.
- The disk figures refresh after a prune instead of redrawing the number they had before
  - The reading is cached for a minute and served stale while it refreshes behind the request, so a successful prune was followed by a page still showing the pre-prune total — which is indistinguishable from a button that did nothing. Every prune now drops the cached reading.
- The networks tab shows how many containers are on each network, instead of zero for every one
  - Docker's network listing never fills in its container map — only an inspect does — so the count was structurally zero on every host, and the delete dialog told you nothing was attached to a network carrying a running stack. The membership is joined from the container list, which already carries it, and the dialog names the containers it would cut off.
- The warning about data written inside a container instead of a volume now fires
  - It reads the container's writable layer size, and Docker omits that from a container listing unless it is explicitly asked for — so the value was always zero and the check had never once run, on any host, while the panel advertised it. It reads the figure from the disk-usage walk instead, which already computes it. On the server this was found on, it immediately reported 28.3 GB sitting in one container's own filesystem, due to be destroyed by its next update.
- Editing or recreating a container keeps its logging settings instead of resetting them to Docker's unlimited default
  - "Edit" here means read the container back and build it again, and the shape it was read into had no room for a log driver — so a container someone had capped came back out of an edit keeping every line it would ever print, in one file that is never rotated, with nothing on screen having changed. The `docker run` and compose previews show the setting too, so a command copied out of this dashboard carries it.
- Deleting a proxy site no longer leaves a second site called <name>.bak behind
  - The delete keeps the previous file beside the original — validation catches a broken config, not a correct one that says the wrong thing, and the only cure for the second is the version before it — but the site list showed every file in the directory, so the copy appeared as a site of its own and deleting that one produced .bak.bak. nginx reads none of these: sites-enabled is a directory of symlinks and conf.d is included as *.conf. The listing skips them now, along with the .dpkg-old and .rpmsave files a package upgrade leaves next to a config it touched, which used to show as a duplicate of every site apt had ever updated.
- Sites can be deleted and edited on hosts that keep their nginx config in conf.d
  - Which is every RPM distribution, Alpine and Arch — most of the servers this runs on. There the site list reports a name that already ends in .conf, and both delete and save appended a second one and acted on app.conf.conf, which exists nowhere: delete answered "no such site" about a site plainly on the page, and save wrote a duplicate while leaving the original serving. The enable switch is gone on those hosts too, replaced by "always on", because conf.d has no symlink to toggle and the control could only ever return an error.
- Basic auth on a site now works — the password file is readable by the server that has to read it
  - nginx opens auth_basic_user_file in a worker, which runs as www-data, nginx or http depending on the distribution, not as the root that wrote it. The file was 0640 root:root, so every visitor to a password-protected site got a 403 and the error log said "Permission denied" — which reads exactly like a wrong password. The group is handed to whoever this host's nginx.conf names, and where that account cannot be resolved the file is world-readable instead, which is what htpasswd itself produces and is a great deal better than a login nobody can pass.
- Extra configuration and the probe blocks survive an edit instead of being deleted by it
  - The site form's escape hatch was the one field saving destroyed: anything typed into "Extra configuration" was written into the file and silently dropped the next time the form read it back, so opening a site and pressing save removed directives nobody was shown. The "Block common probes" switch was the same — it read back as off, so an edit turned it off. Both round-trip now, and a test renders, parses and re-renders to keep them that way.
- A restriction on one path stays on that path when a site is saved again
  - An allow list inside a location block was read back as the site's own, so editing a site whose /admin was limited to a private range and saving applied that limit to the whole site — locking every visitor out of a site that had been public.
- "Does this domain point here?" says it cannot tell, rather than reporting a correct domain as wrong
  - The check compared the domain's addresses against this machine's own routable ones. A VPS behind provider NAT has none — AWS, Google Cloud, Azure and Oracle all give the instance a private address and map a public one in front of it — so on all four the answer was always "this is not an address on this machine", in front of a domain that was configured perfectly. A check that could not run is not a failure any more than it is a pass, and it now says which it is.
- A DNS certificate plugin is found whatever Python the host ships
  - The search named two interpreter versions, so RHEL 9 on python3.9 and Debian 13 and Fedora on 3.13 were all told a plugin they had installed was missing — a refusal in front of a wildcard certificate that would have been issued. The renewal check grew the same treatment: Fedora and RHEL schedule certbot-renew.timer rather than certbot.timer, and Alpine runs it out of /etc/periodic, so all three used to be warned that nothing was renewing while something was.
- A new stream no longer silently replaces an existing one of the same name
  - "New stream" and "Edit this stream" post to one route, and only the site form was passing the flag that tells them apart — so a forwarding rule could stop pointing where it used to with nothing said. The stream page also stops reporting nginx as reading these when the include is present but commented out, which is exactly how it arrives when somebody pastes the snippet and thinks about it.
- Saving a site reports it as enabled only when it actually is
  - If the symlink into sites-enabled could not be written — a read-only directory, or a real file sitting where the link belongs — the failure was swallowed and the page said the site was live. A link left pointing at a different file was the same story with a worse ending: the new config was never in nginx's include tree at all. Both are handled now, and a save that cannot enable the site undoes itself rather than leaving a file nobody can see.
- Password files and stream configs follow JD_NGINX_DIR instead of assuming /etc/nginx
  - Both were written to a hard-coded path, so a host whose nginx lives somewhere else — which is the only reason that setting exists — got files in a directory its nginx never reads. The listening-ports page had a smaller version of the same problem: every connected UDP socket was counted as something the server was accepting on, so an ordinary DNS lookup showed up as an open port.
- Firewall rules written from an application profile now open the port they name
  - Picking "Nginx Full" or "OpenSSH" and nothing else was refused outright by ufw — "Need 'to' or 'from' clause" — so the profile picker never worked on any host for the case it exists for. Adding a source made it worse rather than better: ufw accepted the rule and bound the profile to the *source* port, so what landed in the firewall admitted traffic coming from port 22 rather than going to it. A profile is a destination, and it is written inside a `to` clause now. Each argument list this form builds is checked against a real ufw with --dry-run in the test suite.
- A rule with a destination address is read correctly, warnings and all
  - ufw prints the address in front of the port — "10.0.0.5 5432/tcp" — and the whole column was taken as the port. Everything keyed off the port went quiet with it: no service name, no "this database is open to the world" warning, and an edit that read the rule back with a port nothing could parse. Port lists and ranges get the same treatment, so a rule opening Redis as `6379,6380` now raises the warning it always should have.
- Forwarding rules are recognised instead of being read as inbound ones
  - `ufw route` rules print ALLOW FWD, and ufw-docker writes a great many of them. The word was read as part of the source address, and a rule with no direction counts as inbound — so a host whose only rules were forwarding rules satisfied the "something is allowed in" test that guards switching the inbound default to deny. They are also no longer editable from the rule form, which has no way to express one and would have saved it back as an inbound rule.
- Editing a rule that names only a source no longer tries to write it as an application profile
  - ufw prints "Anywhere" as the destination of a `deny from 203.0.113.9`, and the form read any non-numeric destination as a profile name — so reopening such a rule offered to save `app Anywhere`, which is not a profile on any host.
- fail2ban will not ban the address you are connected from
  - A ban installs a firewall drop, so banning yourself severs the session exactly the way an inbound deny rule would. The firewall page has refused that since it shipped and the ban route reached the same outcome with nothing in the way. Same guard, same narrowness: only the caller's own address is refused.
- A fail2ban allowlist entry survives a restart instead of disappearing at one
  - `addignoreip` changes the running server and nothing else, so the address an operator allowlists after banning themselves was gone the next time fail2ban restarted — silently, with the page still showing it. It is written into the same jail.d drop-in the ban time and retry count already used, which fail2ban reads last.
- The security verdict counts failed logins over a week, not over the whole of btmp
  - The figure was the length of a capped 500-record listing of the entire failed-login file. So the "sustained attempts" threshold of 2000 could never be reached however hard a host was being hit, and the 200-attempt notice fired permanently on every server with a public SSH port regardless of what happened this week. It is a count inside a window now, and where the sample runs out it says "at least" rather than quoting a floor as a total.
- The SSH port control shows the port SSH is actually on
  - On a socket-activated host — Ubuntu 24.04 and later by default — systemd holds the listener and sshd_config's Port is read, resolved and ignored. The panel header said "Port 2222 · held by ssh.socket" while the field under it said 22, and saving that displayed value read as a request to move SSH back onto it.
- Ports are checked for being ports, not for being five digits or fewer
  - 0, 99999 and a range written backwards all matched the pattern and were refused three layers down by whichever tool ran, with an error naming none of the four fields on the form.
- The login pages say why they are empty, and name the package that fixes it
  - "wtmp is not being written here" was the wrong diagnosis: the records are there and it is `last` and `lastb` that are missing, from util-linux-extra, which minimal cloud images leave out. The posture verdict already said so; the panel does now too. A null MX in the DNS tool also reads as a null MX rather than as a preference followed by a blank.

## 0.6.3 — 29 August 2026

**Every page comes back the way you left it**

Hide the file panel on the terminal page, go and look at something else, come back — and it was open again. Every page in this dashboard is thrown away the moment you navigate off it, so every panel you closed, folder you collapsed, tab you chose and sort you set was gone by the time you returned. That is the whole arrangement of a page you come back to all day, and it is answered everywhere at once rather than on the page that annoyed somebody most.

### Added

- Pages remember how you left them arranged — hidden panels, collapsed folders, the tab you were on, the sort you chose
  - One store behind the whole app rather than a fix per page, so it covers the terminal's session rail, its Files/Git companion and which half of that you had open, the folders you collapsed in the rail, the file manager's tree, hidden files and sort order, the tab on Processes, Packages, Account, Deployments, a container, a stack and a repository, the processor's total-or-breakdown switch, "show system accounts", the connections filter, and the sidebar itself, which now stays collapsed across a reload instead of springing back. It is kept in the browser you are sitting at, like the theme and the terminal's font, not on the account. What you were looking at is deliberately not kept: a search box, a selected row, an open dialog and a half-filled form all start empty, because a filter restored from yesterday is a table that looks broken for no visible reason.

### Fixed

- Cards, panels and stat tiles no longer press down like buttons when you click them
  - The lift that makes a control look like something you press is one rule shared by every raised surface in the app, and its pressed state never asked whether the surface was a control. So a click anywhere on a panel — selecting a line of log output, dragging across a table, pressing on a heading — sank the whole card a pixel and took its shadow away, which reads as pressing a button that does nothing. The press now applies only to what a pointer can actually activate: buttons, links, tabs, checkboxes, switches and sliders. Nothing about the resting look changed.

## 0.6.2 — 29 August 2026

**The updater runs an image that is still on the machine**

Pressing Update on a recent Docker daemon could fail immediately with "could not start the updater: No such image: sha256:…", on a dashboard that was working perfectly at the time. Nothing was damaged and no upgrade was half-applied — the run died before it fetched anything — but the button did not work, and the reason it did not was invisible from the page.

### Fixed

- The in-app update no longer fails with "No such image" on Docker's containerd image store
  - The updater runs the backend's own image as a sibling container — that image already carries git, the docker CLI and the compose plugin, so there is nothing to pull — and it took the reference for it from Docker's container listing. That listing reports a tag only while the tag still points at the same image: after a rebuild that moved just-dashboard-backend:latest onto the new build without recreating the backend, it reports a bare sha256 instead. On the containerd image store, which is the default on recent daemons, an untagged image is collected even while a container is running from it — the container keeps its unpacked snapshot and carries on working, which is why nothing looked wrong until the day you pressed Update. The name the compose file pins is used now: it is a tag, so it moves with the rebuilds rather than being orphaned by one.

## 0.6.1 — 29 August 2026

**The last panels that ended at a shell prompt, and a dashboard rebuilt around one design system**

Packages, logs and git history were the three pages that still sent you to ssh — to find out what a package is called, to grep the log that rotated last night, to see which branch a commit is on. They answer in the panel now. The shell around them was rebuilt at the same time: the four features that were a screen of tabs each became their own routes, twelve themes became one palette in light and dark, and every control in the app now looks like something you press.

### Added

- Packages: search the archive, install, remove, and see what a package actually put on your path
  - The reason people open a terminal instead of a package page is that they do not know the name — it is postgresql-client, not psql — so the list updates as you type, and a search that comes back thin is widened to the descriptions, because somebody who does not know the name types what the software does instead. Once a package is installed the second tab answers the question every other panel in this class leaves hanging: which commands it added, which units it registered, what it left in /etc, and its primary manual page rendered next to them. Nothing runs the package's own binaries to find out.
- The package pages work on apt, dnf, yum, zypper, pacman and apk, and say how old the index is
  - Every read answers from the package database already on disk, which is right — a search that refreshed first would take a minute per keystroke — and it means the catalogue is only as current as the last refresh. On a server nobody logs into, that is the first timer to stop, so the age is on screen with the button that fixes it. Removing a package is an ordinary confirmation; purging one, which also deletes the configuration it left in /etc, asks you to type.
- One log filter, applied to every source, over the rotated archives as well as the live file
  - The grep box and the level chips used to be applied to file tails only, so they silently did nothing on the docker, PM2 and journal sources. There is one filter now, compiled once and applied to all of them, and a filtered tail opens on n *matches* rather than n lines — "the last 400 lines" of a log where one line in a thousand is an error is an empty page in front of a file full of them. The rotated generations beside a file are read as part of it, gzip and bzip2 included, so "when did this start" can be asked past last night's logrotate run.
- Log retention is reported as a verdict rather than as logrotate's rule list
  - The file with no rule governing it is the one that fills the disk, and it is exactly the entry a rule list cannot show. A rule that exists and has not run in a fortnight is reported too, since that is the failure this panel is really for.
- A commit graph on the git page, drawn from the same walk that lists the commits
  - Which branch a commit is on, and where the branches met, is the part of git history that a flat list cannot say.
- The dashboard's own version has a page of its own
  - It used to be the top half of a page whose bottom half was the host's packages, on the theory that "what can be updated on this machine" is one question. It is not — one of them is your server and the other is the tool you are looking at it through — and the release notes, which are the part somebody actually reads before upgrading a root-equivalent panel, had nowhere to live but a sheet over a table of library versions.

### Changed

- Docker, Databases, Proxy and Security are each a set of pages now, not one screen of tabs
  - A sticky sub-nav strip, an Overview that points at the detail pages rather than piling everything onto one screen, and a sidebar entry that expands to its children instead of being both a link and a toggle. Metrics took over the old Overview body, which leaves Overview the landing it should always have been: host header, health, an hour of sparklines, recent activity, and a card per service.
- One palette in light and dark, instead of twelve themes
  - Twelve palettes meant twelve places for a colour to be almost right, and no way to tell which of them a screenshot came from. Every verdict in the app now renders through one accordion of findings rather than a stack of tinted alert boxes, and a live state is a coloured dot and a word rather than a filled pill — the tinted badges stay, but only for tags, which are a fixed property of a row and never a state.
- Every control looks like something you press
  - A button now has a face a shade lighter than the surface under it, a hairline of light along its top edge, a dark lip at the bottom and a shadow on the page below — inverting when you press it, so the control sits into the page. Cards make the same claim in the same language rather than in one of their own, and hovering settles a control towards the surface instead of lighting it up. The quiet actions at the end of a table row stay flat, because giving 142 of them a face turns every row into a strip of controls competing with its own data, and the nav stays a list for the same reason: the thing that should stand out in a column of forty-nine items is the one you are on.
- The typed confirmation is reserved for the actions that have no way back
  - A phrase in front of something recoverable is typed rather than read, and that habit is precisely what it is protecting on the routes that keep it. Deleting a proxy site, an nginx stream, an htpasswd file or a git branch, pruning images, networks or containers, and ending an SSH session all still stop you with a confirmation — they no longer ask you to type. What keeps the phrase is what costs you the machine or the data: the firewall and sshd, every DROP, TRUNCATE and restore, removing a volume, compose down, git discard and git reset --hard, and installing a new version of the dashboard itself.

### Fixed

- Clicking a pane in the terminal focuses it, and a killed pane stops leaving a chip behind
  - Both were the pane list being polled only once the window already reported more than one pane — a count up to five seconds stale — so for the seconds after a split there was nothing to click, and for the seconds after a kill there was a chip pointing at a pane that no longer existed.
- The terminal's jump-to-the-end button appears when tmux has actually scrolled
  - It used to appear on the first wheel-up whether or not anything moved — which under a full-screen program that wants the mouse is never — offering to return a terminal that had not gone anywhere, and its button called a scroll the emulator cannot perform under tmux. The pane now asks tmux whether the pane is in copy mode and believes the answer, in both directions.
- Terminal shortcuts only fire where the shell has the keyboard
  - They move sessions, close windows and kill panes, and they were firing from anywhere on the page — so Ctrl+Alt+W closed a tmux window while the operator was clicking around the file tree.
- Box-drawing characters in the terminal line up, and the terminal follows the theme
  - Block and box glyphs are drawn from a vector atlas rather than from the font, which spaced them wrong and broke the border of every full-screen program. The colours are derived from the live theme at runtime, with a neutral ramp mixed per mode so the dim colours stay legible on white as well as on near-black.

**The security and proxy pages say what the machine's posture is, on whatever distribution it runs**

The Security and Proxy pages showed you facts and left the reading to somebody who already knew how. They now grade the machine and say what to do about it — and they work on Fedora, Rocky, openSUSE, Arch and Alpine as well as on Debian and Ubuntu, where before the firewall reported inactive on every host that had one and every non-apt server was told it had nothing to update.

### Security

- An nginx address restriction is now a fence rather than a suggestion
  - nginx reads its access directives in order, stops at the first match, and falls through to permit — so a site restricted to a private range was reachable from anywhere on the internet. The list is now closed with `deny all`, with explicit denials above it so first-match still means what it reads as. One case it still cannot cover is stated rather than papered over: nginx answers a redirect in the rewrite phase, before the access phase runs at all.
- An account list written into sshd_config can no longer carry a directive of its own
  - A newline inside a list of allowed users would have written a setting of the caller's choosing onto the next line of the file.

### Added

- The Security page grades the machine instead of only showing its settings
  - Exposure, firewall, sshd, intrusion prevention, open ports, certificates and pending patches become findings that carry what was measured, what it means, what to do about it, and — where the dashboard can carry out the remedy itself — a button. The rules are deliberately conservative: an exposed database behind a default-deny firewall is a warning rather than a critical, and "turn off password authentication" stops being offered when no account holds a key, because there it is not advice, it is a lockout.
- The firewall page writes firewalld as well as ufw, and says plainly when it can only read
  - firewalld's model is genuinely different — zones, services and rich rules rather than numbered lines — so a rule with a source becomes a rich rule, everything is written --permanent and reloaded, and the page numbers rules positionally. Raw iptables stays read-only on purpose: it has no persistence of its own, so a rule added from here would work until the reboot and then vanish, leaving a page that says protected in front of a host that is not.
- Package updates work on dnf, yum, zypper, pacman and apk, not only apt
  - Every RPM, Arch and Alpine host used to report no package manager, which renders as "nothing to update" rather than "never checked" — so the posture audit's patch check was silently dead on half the servers this runs on. Alpine and Arch publish no advisory data, so they now say the security count cannot be told rather than reporting zero, and a security-only upgrade is refused there instead of quietly applying everything.
- A site builder that writes the nginx for you, shown live beside the form
  - Proxy targets, static roots, redirects, extra paths, WebSocket upgrades, basic auth and address restrictions, rendered on the server so there is one implementation of what a site means. The symlink goes in before nginx -t, because a file not yet in the include tree is one the test has nothing to say about.
- Certificates can be issued over DNS-01 with eight provider plugins, and one you bought can be imported
  - DNS-01 is the only route to a wildcard and the only thing that works behind a CDN. An imported key is checked against its certificate first, because a mismatched pair is accepted by every text editor and refused by nginx at reload — on a live server, during an outage.
- A live TLS report grading what a visitor actually gets
  - Each protocol version is probed on a connection of its own, and reported as unknown where this client would not ask — calling it absent would be a false reassurance about exactly the versions that matter most.
- Streams forward the services that do not speak HTTP, and password files are managed here
  - nginx's stream is a top-level context a server file cannot reach, so these live in their own directory and the page says plainly when nginx.conf does not include it; nginx.conf itself is never edited from here. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt in process, so the credential never becomes an argv that /proc/*/cmdline makes world-readable.
- Long operations run as jobs you can leave and come back to
  - Issuing a certificate, upgrading every package and reloading sshd used to hold a browser request open for the length of the run, so a dropped connection left you with no idea whether your SSH configuration had been applied. The work now descends from the process rather than the request: closing the tab, navigating away and losing the connection all leave it running and the transcript complete, and a finished run can be reopened from a recent list. What stays synchronous is the refusal — a bad email, a wildcard asked for over HTTP, an sshd change that would lock you out — so it answers the click that caused it rather than arriving a minute later as a failed run.
- fail2ban jails can be tuned in place and survive a restart, with a fold of the repeat offenders
  - Settings are written to jail.d/*.local and merged rather than regenerated, so no other jail or hand-written line is lost. The repeat-offenders view answers what a ban list cannot: who keeps coming back.

### Fixed

- The firewall no longer reports itself inactive on every host that has one
  - ufw's parser takes exactly one of `status numbered` and `status verbose`, so asking for both returned an error and no rules — which the page rendered as a firewall that was not running.
- Deleting or editing a firewall rule affects that rule and nothing else
  - A ufw rule written without an address family becomes two entries and deleting by number took only one, leaving its IPv6 twin behind on a page that said the rule was gone. Editing a rule to an unchanged value was worse: ufw answers a duplicate add with "Skipping" and the old number was then deleted anyway, so the rule that vanished was the next one down. Rules are now found again by what they are, in a listing read after the change.
- Moving the SSH port works on Ubuntu 22.10 and later, where systemd owns the listener
  - Socket activation is the default on 24.04: sshd_config's Port is read, resolved and reported back by sshd -T, and ignored, so the control passed validation, reloaded successfully, read back the new value — and the machine went on answering on 22. The socket unit is now read and written alongside the daemon, on both address families, and restarted rather than reloaded, because systemd rebinds a socket's addresses only on restart. The page says which unit holds the port and which port it is actually on.
- The root login setting shows the value sshd reported on a stock Ubuntu
  - OpenSSH 9.9 prints the deprecated spelling of exactly the value the distributions ship as their default, which the control had no entry for — so a security setting read as "not set" on a host where it was set correctly.
- The fail2ban allowlist is readable again
  - Fail2Ban 1.x draws its answer as a tree where 0.x printed a list, so a jail with one allowlisted address showed six entries beginning "These", and a jail with none showed five beginning "No". That is every fail2ban shipping today.
- A check that could not be answered says so, rather than reporting a reassuring zero
  - `last` and `lastb` come from util-linux-extra, which minimal cloud images leave out, so the failed-login count stayed at zero and the verdict called the host quiet. Zero attempts and "the tool that counts them is not installed" are the same number and opposite facts. The check is now listed as skipped, with the package named.
- A failed job reports the code the command exited with
  - The exit code was in every response and nothing ever assigned it, so every failure read "exit 0" — which next to "failed" is a contradiction the reader resolves by ignoring one of the two.

## 0.5.9 — 27 August 2026

**The parts of the last release that only worked on the machine they were written on**

Connecting a database installed on the server asked for nothing and then saved a connection that could not authenticate. The terminal's files and git panel needed tmux to know where the shell was, and said nothing on a host that has none — which is every stock Debian.

### Added

- The terminal says when tmux is missing, and what that costs
  - Windows, panes and a session that survives closing the tab are all tmux's. Without it the split button did nothing and the window strip stayed empty, with nothing on screen explaining why. Debian installs no tmux by default, so the page now says so and names the one command that fixes it.

### Fixed

- Connecting a database that is not in a container asks for its password, and dials before it saves
  - It used to hand you a connection string with the password missing, which could be saved as it stood — the result was a connection that existed, looked connected, and answered "password authentication failed for user postgres" to everything afterwards. Now nothing is stored unless the engine accepts it, and its refusal is shown next to the field that caused it. If the account has never had a password, the dialog names the one command that gives it one.
- The terminal's files and git panel works on a host without tmux
  - The panel is rooted at the shell's current directory, which was only ever read from tmux — so on a machine without it the panel had nowhere to look and stayed empty beside a shell sitting in a repository. The directory is read from the process itself when tmux cannot answer.

## 0.5.8 — 26 August 2026

**Sign in to GitHub from the page that does the pushing**

The git page can now hold a GitHub account: the same one-time code flow gh auth login uses, rendered as a screen. Commits are recorded as you, pushes are authenticated, and a pull request can be opened from the branch you are on. A database installed on the server itself is no longer invisible beside the ones in containers, and the commit box stopped disappearing under a long list of changes.

### Added

- Sign in to GitHub from the git page
  - The same device-code flow as `gh auth login`, as a screen rather than a series of prompts: a one-time code, github.com, done. The token is stored where gh keeps its own — under the account that owns the repository, which is the account that pushes — so it is the same credential a shell on the server would use. A pasted token is the way in for GitHub Enterprise or a machine account.
- Commits and pushes are made as the signed-in account
  - Signing in sets git's credential helper and, when the account has none, a committer name and address from your GitHub profile. The account chip in the header says whether git here will actually use it — including the case where the remote is SSH and the push uses the server's key instead.
- Open a pull request without leaving the page
  - A Pulls tab beside Changes and History: what is open, which one belongs to the branch you are on, and a form that pushes the branch and opens the request as your account.
- Databases installed on the server itself are found, not just the ones in containers
  - A Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, ClickHouse or SQL Server that apt installed is recognised from the process listening for it, on whatever port it actually uses. The ones that ship with no credentials connect themselves; the rest say they are there and open the connection form with everything except the password already filled in — a container states its credentials in its environment, a native server keeps them in its own catalogue, and guessing at them would be an authentication failure in your own logs.

### Changed

- Pushing a new branch publishes it instead of refusing
  - A branch with no upstream used to be answered with git's advice to run a command in a terminal. It now sets the upstream, which is also what makes a pull request possible from a branch created here.

### Fixed

- The commit box stays visible however many files have changed
  - The changes list scrolls inside its own panel now. It used to push the commit box off the bottom of a page that does not scroll, which put committing out of reach exactly when there was most to commit.
- A host with no Docker socket can still find its databases
  - Detection answered “unavailable” for the whole question when Docker was missing, which on a plain VPS meant every database on it.
- The search button sits on the same line as every other icon in the collapsed sidebar
  - The rail is 3rem and its buttons are 2rem; the header kept a wider padding than the nav below it, so the one button in it overflowed half a rem to the right.

### Removed

- The “Amend last commit” checkbox on the git page

## 0.5.7 — 26 August 2026

**Selecting and copying in the terminal, as everywhere else**

Text dragged in a terminal pane unhighlighted itself the moment the mouse came up, and the Copy button and its shortcut both answered that nothing was selected. tmux owned the pointer; it now owns only the wheel.

### Added

- Ctrl+C copies the selection, and interrupts when there is nothing selected
  - Copying clears the selection as it goes, so the next Ctrl+C is an interrupt again. Ctrl+Shift+C still works and is still rebindable.
- Ctrl+V pastes
  - It used to send a literal ^V instead. The multi-line paste confirmation still sees it.

### Changed

- Hold Alt to hand the mouse to the program in the pane
  - For vim, htop, less and anything else that wants to be clicked. The wheel still scrolls the session's history with no modifier at all.

### Fixed

- A plain drag selects text, and it stays selected
  - tmux's mouse mode was taking the drag, drawing its own selection and clearing it on mouse-up — so the browser never had one, which is why every way of copying reported an empty selection.

## 0.5.6 — 26 August 2026

**Connect the database your application already uses**

A database on a Docker network with no published port — how nearly every application ships its own Postgres — was refused as unreachable. It was never unreachable: the dashboard shares the host's network namespace, and a Docker bridge is routable from there.

### Changed

- A published port is still preferred where there is one
  - It survives the container being recreated. A container address does not, so a connection made that way needs reconnecting after a redeploy — the Databases page marks which is which.

### Fixed

- A database with no published port now connects at its container address
  - The commonest database on any server this runs on was the one database the dashboard declined, while psql from the same machine worked fine.

## 0.5.5 — 26 August 2026

**The updater can build again**

Installing an update failed while building, with "the --mount option requires BuildKit". The updater's image was missing the buildx plugin, so it quietly built with the classic builder — which cannot read this project's own Dockerfile.

### Changed

- Builds are slower the first time and correct every time
  - The Go build cache mounts are gone, because they are a BuildKit extension the classic builder refuses outright rather than ignores.

### Fixed

- Installing an update no longer fails with "the --mount option requires BuildKit"
  - Compose delegates builds to buildx and falls back to the classic builder without saying so when it is absent. The image now carries buildx, and the Dockerfile no longer needs it — so an install already stuck on this can update its way out.

## 0.5.4 — 26 August 2026

**A taken port fails loudly**

A port already in use now stops the stack with a message naming it, instead of leaving the dashboard quietly serving whatever already held the port. Upgrading installs get their ports filled in automatically.

### Changed

- Re-running install.sh fills in ports missing from an older .env
  - No hand-editing to upgrade an install made before the ports were settings. A port already recorded is never moved — that was a deliberate choice, and guessing whether the process holding it is this dashboard is how a working install gets broken.

### Fixed

- A port already in use stops the stack instead of serving the wrong application
  - The frontend runs on its own network with its port published, so Docker refuses to start it and names the port. Previously it failed to bind, restarted in a loop, and the proxy forwarded to whatever already held the port.
- install.sh no longer exits early on an .env without the port settings
  - Reading an absent variable aborted the script under set -euo pipefail, so a re-run stopped before printing how to connect.

## 0.5.3 — 26 August 2026

**Say why a database was not connected**

A database running on this server that the dashboard recognises but cannot reach — almost always a container on a Docker network with no published port — used to be skipped in silence. The reconcile now names it and says what is in the way.

### Added

- The reason a database was not connected, on the Databases page
  - Most often that its port is published only inside its own Docker network. Publish it on 127.0.0.1 and it connects itself on the next visit.

### Fixed

- A database that cannot be reached is named instead of silently skipped
  - Its credentials were read and its container recognised, then it was dropped without a word — so the Databases page appeared to do nothing about a database sitting in plain sight on the Docker page.

## 0.5.2 — 26 August 2026

**Ports that do not collide**

The dashboard's three ports — 8443, 8080 and 3000 — are the three most contested numbers on a Linux server, and a machine already using one of them got a dashboard that silently served somebody else's application. All three are now settings, and the installer picks free ones.

### Added

- JD_PORT, JD_BACKEND_PORT and JD_FRONTEND_PORT
  - Change any of the three in .env. The compose file and the proxy read the same variables, so they cannot drift apart.

### Changed

- install.sh checks all three ports and picks free ones
  - It says which port was taken and what it used instead, and the connection details it prints at the end carry the ports it actually chose.
- `bun dev` follows JD_BACKEND_PORT
  - A developer who moved the backend off 8080 no longer has to find a second variable to keep the dev proxy working.

### Fixed

- A port already in use no longer serves you the wrong application
  - Only the frontend and backend failed to bind; the proxy came up clean and forwarded to whatever already held the port, so you reached another app over the dashboard's own certificate with nothing anywhere saying why.

## 0.5.1 — 26 August 2026

**Updates, in the dashboard**

Just Dashboard now tells you when a new version exists, shows you exactly what is in it, and installs it for you. Until now the only way to find out was to visit the repository, and the only way to upgrade was to ssh in and rebuild by hand.

### Added

- A notice above your account in the sidebar when a newer version is out
  - It carries the version, what the release is called, and two buttons: install it, or read what changed first. It is not there at all when you are up to date.
- Release notes for every version between the one you run and the newest
  - An install three versions behind is upgrading past three sets of changes, so all three are shown rather than only the last.
- One-click install: pull, rebuild and restart the whole stack
  - The upgrade runs in a separate container so it survives the dashboard being rebuilt underneath it, and it waits for the dashboard to answer again before calling itself finished.
- A live transcript of the upgrade, and the outcome once it is done
  - The page keeps watching while the backend restarts, so you see the build output rather than a spinner and a guess.
- The dashboard's own version and history on the Updates page, beside the host's packages
- JD_UPDATE_CHECK, JD_UPDATE_REPO, JD_UPDATE_BRANCH and JD_UPDATE_DIR
  - Turn the online check off entirely, follow a fork, follow a different branch, or name the directory you installed into.

### Changed

- Local changes in the install directory are kept, not discarded
  - The upgrade fast-forwards rather than resetting, so an edited compose file or Caddyfile survives — and when one genuinely collides, the upgrade stops and says what is in the way instead of deleting it.

## 0.5 — 22 August 2026
