/**
 * How a page was arranged, kept in the browser.
 *
 * Every page in this app is unmounted the moment you navigate away from it, so
 * anything held in `useState` is gone by the time you come back: the file
 * panel you closed on the terminal page is open again, the folder you
 * collapsed is expanded, the tab you were on is the default one. That is
 * indistinguishable from the dashboard ignoring you, and it is worst on
 * exactly the screens somebody leaves and returns to all day.
 *
 * The line this store draws is between **how the page is arranged** and **what
 * you were looking at**. A hidden panel, a collapsed group, a chosen tab, a
 * sort order, a "show system accounts" switch are all decisions about the
 * furniture, and they are remembered. A search box, a selected row, an open
 * dialog and a half-filled form are the question being asked right now, and
 * they are not — a page that restored yesterday's filter would show an empty
 * table with no obvious reason for it, which is the failure this store exists
 * to avoid rather than one to introduce from the other side.
 *
 * On the screen and not on the account, for the same reason the theme and the
 * terminal's font are: whether the file tree is worth a fifth of the window is
 * a property of the window. localStorage rather than session, so a reload
 * keeps it too — the state survives an upgrade restarting the backend under
 * the tab, which is a thing that happens here.
 *
 * Sibling of `panel-size.ts`, which does the same for a dragged width and
 * stays separate: a width is a number with its own clamping rules and its own
 * "reset to normal", and folding it in here would make both stores worse.

 * the kind that changed, which is what a rewrite actually does, and does not

 *

 * page is a one-line change and reading it later needs no explanation. `key`
 * is a dotted path naming the page and the thing (`terminal.tools`,
 * `files.sort`); it is stored, so renaming one silently resets it, which is
 * the correct outcome for a control that has changed enough to be renamed.
 *
 * The server has no localStorage, so the first paint is always the fallback
 * and the stored value arrives on hydration. `useSyncExternalStore` is what
 * makes that legal rather than a mismatch: React renders the server snapshot,
 * then re-renders once against the real one.
