/**
 * Padding for a scrolling container that holds focusable controls.
 *
 * A focus ring is drawn *outside* the control's border box — three pixels of
 * it in this design system — and any container whose overflow is not `visible`
 * clips it. Setting one axis to `auto` makes the other `auto` too, so an
 * `overflow-y-auto` list clips the ring on all four sides rather than only the
 * two it scrolls on. The symptom is a highlight that looks bitten off along
 * whichever edge the control is nearest, which in a dense form is most of them.
 *
 * Four pixels clears the three-pixel ring and the border it sits outside.
 * Scroll containers with focusable children should carry this instead of a
 * one-sided `pr-1`, which only ever gave the scrollbar room.
