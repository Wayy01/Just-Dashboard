/**
 * How wide the operator dragged a side panel, kept in the browser.
 *
 * On the screen rather than on the account, for the same reason the theme and
 * the terminal's font are: how much of a 13" laptop the file tree deserves is
 * a property of the laptop. It also means a width survives a reload and a
 * navigation, which is the whole reason to drag one — a panel that snapped
 * back to 21rem on every visit would be adjusted once and then left alone.
 *
 * Stored as a number of pixels. Clamping is the caller's, because only the
 * page knows what else is on the row: a stored width that was reasonable on a
 * wide monitor has to give way on a narrow one rather than push the terminal
 * off the screen.
