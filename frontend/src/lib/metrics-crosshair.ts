/**
 * The instant the pointer is over, shared by every chart on the page.
 *
 * This is the one thing Netdata does that nothing else in this class does at
 * all, and it is the difference between a page of graphs and a page you can
 * actually read. Hovering the CPU chart at 03:14 puts a line at 03:14 on the
 * memory chart, the network chart and the disk chart at the same time, so the
 * question "what else was happening then" is answered by moving the mouse
 * instead of by squinting across four independently-scaled x-axes.
 *
 * Held outside React for the same reason the live metrics buffer is: a pointer
 * moving across a chart fires continuously, and routing that through a context
 * above the router would re-render the terminal and the log tail on every
 * mousemove. Explicit subscribers mean only the parts that draw a crosshair
 * re-render — which is deliberately *not* the charts themselves, see
 * `SyncedCrosshair` in `components/metrics/metric-chart.tsx`.
 *
 * The value is a timestamp in epoch milliseconds rather than a row index,
 * because the charts on a page do not share a row array — the storage chart
 * has its own buckets, and a container chart has its own window entirely. A
 * time is the only thing they all agree on.
