/**
 * The app's toasts, in one place.
 *
 * Every call site was reaching for sonner directly and deciding for itself how
 * to turn a failure into words, which produced three different habits across
 * one page: some passed `String(err)`, which prefixes the name of the exception
 * class and put "ApiError:" in front of a message meant for a person; some
 * passed `err.message`; some passed nothing and left the reader with "Could not
 * save" and no reason. `notify.error` takes the error itself and unwraps it, so
 * getting that right is not something each caller has to remember.
 *
 * It is a thin layer over sonner rather than a replacement for it. Sonner is
 * the shadcn default and renders through `components/ui/sonner`, where the
 * theming and the layout live; this is only about what is *said* and how the
 * arguments are shaped, so anything sonner can do is still reachable through
 * `notify.raw`.
