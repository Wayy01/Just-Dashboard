/**
 * The terminal's keyboard shortcuts, and the fact that they are the operator's
 * to change.
 *
 * A web terminal is the one place where a fixed shortcut is guaranteed to be
 * wrong for somebody. The chord has to get past three layers before it means
 * anything: the browser, which owns Ctrl+T and Ctrl+W outright; the page; and
 * the shell inside the pane, which owns Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D and every Alt chord a
 * reader might use for word motion. tmux solved this with a prefix key nobody
 * agrees on either — `C-b` for some, `C-a` for the ex-screen half of the world
 * — which is exactly the point: there is no default that does not annoy
 * someone, so the defaults here are a starting position rather than a claim.
 *
 * Ctrl+Alt is the default family because it is the one combination neither the
 * browser nor a shell has a use for. Ctrl+Shift is the emulator's own, which is
 * the convention every terminal on Linux already follows.
 *
 * Matching is on `event.code` — the physical key — not `event.key`. A binding
 * recorded on a QWERTY machine has to keep working when the operator switches
 * to a Romanian layout, and `key` is the character the layout produces.
