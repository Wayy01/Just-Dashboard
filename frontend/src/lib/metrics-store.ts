/**
 * The live metrics the Overview page draws, kept outside React.
 *
 * Two problems this solves, both of which come from the same mistake — owning
 * five minutes of history in a route component:
 *
 *  - Leaving the page threw the history away, so coming back showed an empty
 *    chart that took five minutes to fill in again. The stream now runs for as
 *    long as the dashboard shell is mounted, so the graph is continuous across
 *    navigation and there is no re-connect handshake on arrival.
 *  - Pushing every 2s frame through a context above the router would re-render
 *    the whole app — including the terminal and the log tail — twice a second.
 *    A store with explicit subscribers means only the components that actually
 *    read metrics re-render.
 *
 * The history is mirrored into sessionStorage so a browser reload keeps its
 * chart, and points older than STALE_MS are dropped on the way back in: a
 * graph that silently stitches this minute onto one from an hour ago is worse
 * than a graph that starts empty.
