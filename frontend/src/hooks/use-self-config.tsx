/**
 * The dashboard's own settings, and the restart that puts a change into
 * effect.
 *
 * The gotcha is the same one internal/selfcfg is built around: **the backend
 * goes away in the middle of the thing this is watching**. Applying a setting
 * recreates the container serving this API, so the poll starts failing, and a
 * UI that rendered a failed poll as an error would report the restart as
 * broken at exactly the moment it is working. So the last good report is kept
 * (usePoll does that already) and a failure while a run is in flight is
 * rendered as "restarting", not as a fault.
 *
 * The second gotcha has no equivalent in the update flow: a change to the port
 * or the address means the dashboard does not come back *here*. Nothing on
 * this side can follow it — the record says where it went, and the card says
 * so in as many words rather than spinning forever on an address that is now
 * answering nothing.
