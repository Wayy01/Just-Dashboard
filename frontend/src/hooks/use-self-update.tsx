/**
 * The dashboard's own version, shared by the sidebar notice and the Dashboard
 * page.
 *
 * A provider rather than a hook per component, for one reason and one gotcha.
 * The reason: both are on screen at once on /dashboard, and two polls of the
 * same three facts is one too many. The gotcha is the whole design problem of
 * this feature — **the backend goes away in the middle of the thing we are
 * watching**. An upgrade recreates the container serving this API, so the poll
 * starts failing, and a UI that renders a failed poll as an error would report
 * the update as broken at precisely the moment it is working. So the last good
 * report is kept (usePoll does that already), and a failure while a run was in
 * flight is rendered as "restarting", not as a fault.
 *
 * Every page load also *asks*: the first read carries `nudge`, which tells the
 * server to check the repository behind the request rather than inside it, and
 * one quick follow-up read picks the answer up. That is what makes a reload a
 * way of finding out there is a new version, without making a reload wait on
 * a network the server may not have.
 *
 * The frontend container is recreated too, so the page it is running is served
 * by something that is briefly not there. Nothing here can fix that — but the
 * JavaScript is already loaded, so as long as nobody reloads, this keeps
 * polling and picks the story back up. The card says so.

 * should wait fifteen seconds on a repository that is unreachable. So the
 * first response is the cached answer, and this is what picks up the fresh one
 * a second or two later. Exactly one of these: after it the poll drops to the
 * idle cadence, because the question has been asked and answered.
