/**
 * The icon vocabulary.
 *
 * Every glyph in the product comes from here, and here is the only file that
 * names the icon library. That is the same argument `logo.tsx` makes about the
 * wordmark: an icon set is a visual language, and one imported directly by a
 * hundred and forty feature files is one nobody can change, audit or keep
 * consistent. A page that wants "the delete glyph" should not be choosing
 * between `Trash`, `Trash2` and `Delete` — it asks for `Trash` and gets
 * whatever this file has decided that means.
 *
 * The set is **Heroicons** (the 24px solid family), and every name below is
 * this product's own word for the glyph — `Trash`, not `TrashIcon` — so the
 * hundred-plus files importing this module never name Heroicons themselves.
 * Where Heroicons draws one thing for several of our words — `Clock` and
 * `Stopwatch`, `Link` and `Linked`, `Shield` and `ShieldCheck` — they share
 * the glyph, because that is what they always were. Where Heroicons has no
 * drawing at all — there is no floppy disk, no git branch, no sidebar — the
 * mapping picks the nearest true thing (`DocumentArrowDown` for save,
 * `Share` for a branch, `ViewColumns` for a sidebar) and says so next to it.
 *
 * **Both themes come free, and that is a property to protect.** Every glyph
 * here paints with `fill="currentColor"` and nothing else — no hard-coded hex,
 * no gradient, no light-mode assumption. An icon is therefore whatever the text
 * colour around it is, which means it inherits `text-muted-foreground` on a
 * near-white card and on a near-black one without either being a special case.
 *
 * File-type glyphs do not live here. The file browser's per-extension
 * vocabulary is Material Design Icons in `files/file-icon.tsx` — a general UI
 * set has no `JSON` or `JPG` to draw, and MDI's file boxes do. The `File`,
 * `Folder*` and `Acronym*` names below are only the generic chrome (a new
 * folder button, an empty-state sheet, a JSON badge outside the file browser).
