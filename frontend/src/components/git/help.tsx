/**
 * The teaching layer for git, in the shape docker/explain.tsx established: the
 * vocabulary is the actual barrier, not the buttons, so the explanation lives
 * where the choice is made. Two forms — a term with its meaning one hover away,
 * and a "how it works" card that lays out the four-step flow — because the
 * person this is for has heard "commit" and "push" and does not know which
 * order they go in or what each one actually does to their files.
 *
 * The rule is the same one that keeps the docker forms usable: the explanation
 * is quiet. An expert skims past it; a newcomer stops to read it.
