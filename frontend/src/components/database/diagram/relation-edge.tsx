/**
 * A foreign key, drawn between the two columns it relates.
 *
 * Smooth-step rather than a bezier: a bezier between two rows of a table looks
 * like a wire and gives no sense of direction, while an orthogonal path with
 * rounded corners reads as a route from one row to another — which is what
 * schema tools have always drawn and what makes a dense diagram followable.
 *
 * The label is the cardinality, in crow's-foot terms rather than jargon, and it
 * appears only when the edge is involved in whatever is focused. A diagram with
 * a label on every line is a diagram nobody can read.
