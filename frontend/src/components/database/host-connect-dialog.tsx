/**
 * Connecting a database that is installed on the server rather than running in
 * a container.
 *
 * Everything about it is already known — the engine, the address, the account
 * it conventionally uses — except the one thing that is kept inside the server
 * itself. A container states its credentials in its environment and the
 * dashboard reads them; a Postgres that apt installed keeps its passwords in
 * its own catalogue, and no amount of reading the machine reveals them.
 *
 * So this asks for exactly that, and the request it makes **dials before it
 * saves**. The version before it filled a connection string into the general
 * form with the password left out, which could be saved as it stood: the
 * result was a connection that existed, looked connected, and answered
 * "password authentication failed for user postgres" to everything asked of it
 * afterwards. The engine's refusal belongs here, next to the field that caused
 * it, rather than in a red badge on a row somebody then has to delete.
 */
/**
 * How to give the account a password, per engine, for the case where it has
