/**
 * Watching a long command run, instead of waiting for one.
 *
 * `docker compose up` on a stack that has to pull four images and build one
 * takes minutes. Every other panel in this class runs it as a request that
 * hangs for those minutes and then produces a wall of text — which is
 * indistinguishable from a broken dashboard, and is the single most common
 * reason an operator who has been burned once goes back to ssh. Dockge got
 * this right and it is most of why people like it.
 *
 * So: a socket, the same output a terminal would have shown, arriving as it
 * happens. The exit code comes as its own frame rather than being inferred
 * from the text, because compose prints its failures as ordinary lines and a
 * reader watching only the words cannot tell a build that failed from one that
 * was noisy.
