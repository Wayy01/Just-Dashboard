 * The teaching layer.
 *
 * Docker's vocabulary is the actual barrier to using it, not its commands. An
 * operator who has never met it does not need a tooltip saying "Bind mount" —
 * they need to be told that a volume is storage Docker manages for you, a bind
 * mount is a folder on this server handed to the container, and choosing wrong
 * is how people lose data. Every panel in this feature therefore says what
 * things are in the place the choice is made, not in documentation somewhere
 * else.
 *
 * The rule these components enforce is that the explanation is *quiet*: a
 * short line under the field for the thing you need to know to answer, and a
 * hover card for the paragraph behind it. A form that shouts every caveat at
 * once is as unusable as one that explains nothing, and this is the shape that
 * lets an expert skim past what a newcomer stops to read.

    title: "Container",
    body: "One running copy of an image. It has its own filesystem, network address and processes, but shares the server's kernel. Anything it writes inside itself is lost when it is replaced, which is what volumes are for.",

  tag: {
    title: "Tag",
    body: "The version part of an image name, after the colon. `latest` is not a version — it means whatever the publisher last pushed, so two servers running `latest` can be running different software. Pinning a real version is what makes an update something you choose.",
