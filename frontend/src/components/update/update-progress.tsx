/**
 * An upgrade, watched rather than waited for — and watched across the moment
 * the thing serving this page is replaced.
 *
 * The transcript is polled rather than streamed, and that is not a shortcut.
 * Every other long command in this dashboard is followed over a WebSocket, but
 * a socket to a backend that is about to be destroyed and rebuilt cannot
 * survive the one event the operator most wants to see. The record is on disk,
 * written by a container that outlives the restart, so a poll picks the story
 * up wherever it left off — including from a backend that did not exist when
 * the upgrade began.
 *
 * `restarting` is the state that has to be shown as progress rather than as a
 * fault: the API being unreachable during an upgrade is the upgrade happening.
