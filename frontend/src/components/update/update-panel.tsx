/**
 * The dashboard's own version, on the page that is already about updating
 * things.
 *
 * The sidebar notice is the one that finds you; this is the one you go
 * looking for, and it is the only place with room for the transcript of an
 * upgrade that has gone wrong. Both read the same poll, so they can never
 * disagree about what is happening.
 *
 * It is deliberately at the top of a page whose other half is apt: "what can
 * be updated on this machine" is one question, and answering it in two places
 * is how an operator ends up with a current server running last year's panel.
