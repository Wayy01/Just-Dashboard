 * The wordmark, which is the entire logo.
 *
 * There is no mark, no glyph and no tile. A single-server panel is opened by
 * the person who installed it, on their own network, and a symbol in front of
 * the name is a brand asset for a product with strangers to introduce itself
 * to — here it only spent the width the name could have had. "Just" takes the
 * theme's accent and "Dashboard" the text colour, so the logo is recoloured by
 * the palette like everything else rather than sitting in the corner as the
 * one fixed-colour object on screen.
 *
 * The version rides beside it because this is software an operator upgrades by
 * pulling and rebuilding: "which one am I looking at" is a real question, and
 * the answer belongs where they already look rather than on a page nobody
 * visits.
