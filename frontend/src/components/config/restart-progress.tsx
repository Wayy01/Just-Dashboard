/**
 * A restart, watched rather than waited for — and watched across the moment
 * the thing serving this page is replaced.
 *
 * Polled rather than streamed, for the reason the update panel is: a socket to
 * a backend that is about to be destroyed and recreated cannot survive the one
 * event the operator most wants to see. The record is on disk, written by a
 * container that outlives the restart.
 *
 * The state this component exists for is the fourth one. A restart can succeed,
 * fail, or be *rolled back* — the new configuration did not come up, the
 * previous one was put back, and the dashboard is running exactly as it was.
 * That is a failure of the change and a success of the safety net, and showing
 * it as either alone would misreport what happened.
