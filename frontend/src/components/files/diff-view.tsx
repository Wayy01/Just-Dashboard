/**
 * A unified diff, coloured the usual way: additions green, removals red, hunk
 * headers in the accent.
 *
 * One renderer for every place a diff is shown — the git page, the terminal's
 * companion panel — so the colouring and the line handling stay identical
 * wherever a diff turns up rather than drifting into three near-copies.
 *
 * **git's plumbing header is dropped.** Every diff opens with four lines that
 * exist for `git apply` and for nobody reading one:
 *
 * ```
 * diff --git a/path/to/thing.txt b/path/to/thing.txt
 * index 03e0908..7bcfcaa 100644
 * --- a/path/to/thing.txt
 * +++ b/path/to/thing.txt
 * ```
 *
 * They say the path four times — a path already at the top of the panel that
 * opened the diff — plus two blob hashes nobody can do anything with. On a
 * narrow side panel that is the first screenful. What survives is the part
 * that carries information: a rename, and the `diff --git` line itself *when
 * there is more than one file*, redrawn as a heading, because in a commit's
 * diff it is the only thing separating one file from the next.
