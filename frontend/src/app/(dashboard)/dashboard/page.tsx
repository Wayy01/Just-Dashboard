/**
 * The dashboard's own version, and everything it has ever been.
 *
 * This used to be the top half of a page whose bottom half was apt, on the
 * theory that "what can be updated on this machine" is one question. It is
 * not: one of them is the operator's server and the other is the tool they
 * are looking at it through, they are updated by completely different
 * machinery, and the release notes — the part somebody actually reads before
 * upgrading a root-equivalent panel — had nowhere to live but a sheet over
 * the top of a package table.
 *
 * So the history is the page now, and the update control sits above it. The
 * check itself needs no button: opening this page is what asks (see
 * SelfUpdateProvider), which is why "Checked" below is usually seconds old.
