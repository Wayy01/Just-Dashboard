/**
 * The blast radius of a render error.
 *
 * Without this, one component reading a field that arrived as `null` takes the
 * entire dashboard to a blank white page — no nav, no way back, nothing on
 * screen to say what happened. That is exactly what a closed detail panel
 * fetching a list endpoint did: `data.services.map` on an array, one
 * TypeError, whole app gone.
 *
 * The underlying bug is fixed and the API no longer emits `null` where the
 * client expects a list. This is the floor under the next one: a route segment
 * that throws now loses that segment and keeps the shell, and says what broke
 * rather than showing nothing. Next's App Router mounts this automatically for
 * everything under `(dashboard)`.
 *
 * `reset()` re-renders the segment from scratch, which is genuinely the fix for
 * the common case — a transient bad payload that the next poll replaces.
