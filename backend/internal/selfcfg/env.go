// Package selfcfg is the dashboard's own runtime configuration: the ports it
// listens on, the address it answers for, who may reach it, and the two
// buttons that put a change into effect.
//
// Everything here operates on one file — the `.env` beside the compose file in
// the checkout this dashboard was installed from — and on the stack that reads
// it. That is deliberate. The alternative was a second source of truth in the
// database, which would have meant an operator editing .env over ssh and a
// dashboard confidently reporting something else. There is one file, the
// dashboard writes it the same way a person would, and `docker compose up -d`
// is what makes it real.
//
// The dangerous part is not the writing, it is that applying a change restarts
// the process serving the request that asked for it — the same problem
// internal/selfupdate solves, solved the same way: a sibling container carries
// out the work, writes its progress to a file both halves can read, and puts
// the old configuration back if the new one does not come up.
