// The one configuration in which a browser opening this dashboard sees an
// ordinary padlock and no warning.
//
// Everything else about reaching a private dashboard over TLS is a compromise.
// Caddy's internal CA encrypts perfectly well but nothing outside this machine
// has heard of the issuer, so every browser says "not secure" — which teaches
// the operator to click through certificate warnings, on the panel that has
// root on their server. Public ACME cannot help either: there is no public DNS
// name and no public address to validate against.
//
// Tailscale can, and it is the reason this file exists. A tailnet with HTTPS
// enabled gets Let's Encrypt certificates for its MagicDNS names through
// Tailscale's own DNS-01 validation, so `tailscale cert box.tailnet.ts.net`
// returns a genuinely trusted certificate for a name that resolves only inside
// the tailnet. The dashboard then answers on https://box.tailnet.ts.net:8443
// with no warning to click through and nothing to explain.
//
// The certificate is short-lived, which is what makes this a keeper rather
// than an install step: it is checked daily and renewed well before it runs
// out, and the proxy is restarted afterwards because Caddy reads a file-based
// certificate once, at start-up.
