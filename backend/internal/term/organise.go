// Organising sessions, and the windows inside them.
//
// A dashboard terminal is not one shell, it is the five an operator keeps open
// — a tail here, a build there, a database console, a root shell for the thing
// that just broke. Every tool in this class stops at "a terminal": Cockpit has
// exactly one and loses it on navigation, ttyd and Wetty have no session
// concept at all, and Portainer's console is per-container and dies with the
// tab. tmux solves the *keeping* and solves none of the *finding*: `vpsd-3f2a`
// next to `vpsd-91c4` is not an answer to "which one was the migration".
//
// So the shape borrowed here is the one that works elsewhere: VS Code's
// terminal tab list, where every tab has a name you set and keeps it, and
// Guacamole's connection groups, where a long list becomes a short one by
// being folded. Favourites pin the two or three you actually live in.
//
// All of it is stored on the tmux session itself, as user options. tmux keeps
// anything prefixed with `@` as free-form metadata, which makes the session its
// own record — the same property that makes the work survive is what makes the
// *name* of the work survive, with no table to migrate and nothing to
// reconcile after a restart.

// the hue is chosen here and the *shade* is left to the stylesheet. The other
