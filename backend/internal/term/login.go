// This file answers one question: what does "open a terminal" mean on a
// machine where the dashboard is a container?
//
// The honest answer is that it has to mean the same thing as `ssh` to the
// server, because that is the only definition an operator can predict. A shell
// that lands in the image instead has none of what makes the box theirs: not
// their tools (nvim, node, a language runtime installed under their home), not
// their account, not their home directory, not the PATH their dotfiles build.
// It looks like a terminal and answers to `ls`, which is worse than not being
// there — it invites you to trust it.
//
// So the session is assembled the way sshd assembles one: pick the account,
// cross into the host's namespaces, become that account, and exec its login
// shell. Every piece below exists to make one of those four true.

// Account is who the shell runs as — the same set of facts sshd reads out of
// /etc/passwd before it hands over a session.

// A configured name wins and is never silently substituted: an operator who
// writes JD_TERMINAL_USER=deploy and gets a root shell instead has been handed
// the opposite of what they asked for, so an unknown name is an error the
// terminal reports rather than a default it papers over.
//
// With nothing configured, the account is the lowest regular UID on the host —
// on a VPS that is the login the provider created (`ubuntu`, `debian`,
// `admin`), which is the account whose password the operator holds and whose
// home holds their dotfiles. It is the same account `ssh` would land in, which
