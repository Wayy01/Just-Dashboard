// Diagnosis is the dashboard's opinion of what Docker on this server is doing
// wrong.

// Every tool in this class shows the same facts: a state, an exit code, a
// restart count, a port list. None of them says what those facts mean. An
// operator who has run containers for years reads "Exited (137)" as "the
// kernel killed it for using too much memory"; everybody else reads it as a
// number, searches for it, and finds six answers. The facts are already on
// screen — this turns them into sentences, and where there is something the
// dashboard can do about it, into a button.
//
// The rules are deliberately conservative. A dashboard that cries wolf gets
// ignored wholesale, so nothing here fires on a container that is merely
// unusual: every finding is either something already broken, something that
// will break on the next reboot, or something that is quietly costing disk or
// exposure right now.
