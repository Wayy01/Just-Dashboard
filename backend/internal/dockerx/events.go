// The Docker event stream, kept rather than merely forwarded.
//
// Everything the daemon does emits an event: a container started, an image
// pulled, a network created, a container killed by the OOM reaper. Docker
// keeps none of them — `docker events` shows you what happens from the moment
// you run it, which means the answer to "what happened at 04:00" is nowhere,
// and the answer to "why did this container restart" is a shrug.
//
// This is the same argument the metrics recorder in internal/metrics makes
// about samples, and it has the same answer: the dashboard is a long-running
// process that is already connected to the thing producing the record, so it
// should be listening while nobody is looking. The buffer is in memory and
// bounded — an event log worth keeping across restarts belongs in the audit
// table, which already holds everything this dashboard itself did. What the
// daemon does on its own is worth an hour of context, not a database.

// Event is one thing that happened, in a shape the UI can render directly.
