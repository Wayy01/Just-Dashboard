// Package jobs runs the operations that take longer than a request should.
//
// The dashboard already streams `docker compose up` line by line, and that
// runner is scoped to its socket: closing the tab kills the command, and
// reconnecting re-issues the GET and runs it again. For compose that is a
// defensible trade — the frontend refuses to reconnect for exactly that
// reason — but it is the wrong shape for the operations here.
//
// A certbot issue takes up to a few minutes and a package upgrade can take
// half an hour, and both are things an operator starts and then goes and does
// something else. Neither should die because a VPN blinked, and neither should
// start over because somebody reopened the page. So a job is *detached*: it
// descends from context.Background() like the deploy and backup work does, it
// buffers its own output, and a client attaches to it by id rather than by
// starting it.
//
// That inverts the compose runner's compromise. Reconnecting is safe here
// because the socket does not own the work; the sequence number on each line
// is what lets a returning client pick up where it stopped rather than
// replaying from the beginning.
