// of sshd directives, a table of open ports. Reading all of that and deciding
// whether the machine is in reasonable shape is a skill, and the people who
// most need the answer are exactly the people who do not have it. Every
// competitor in this space either shows the facts and stops (Cockpit, Webmin)

// to optimise the number.

// Assess is a pure function of everything it judges. The handler gathers the
// inputs; this decides. That is what makes the rules testable without a
// firewall, an sshd or a network.
