// SSH is where a single-server operator is actually attacked.

// who may knock; sshd decides what happens next, and its defaults are a
// compromise struck for compatibility across twenty years of clients rather
// than for a machine sitting on a public address. The three settings that
// matter — root login, password authentication and empty passwords — are one
// line each in a file nobody opens, and the difference between them being
// right and wrong is the difference between a bot wasting its time and a bot
// getting in.
//
// So this reads the *effective* configuration rather than the file: `sshd -T`
// resolves includes, defaults and the values sshd will really use, and a file
// that sets PasswordAuthentication twice does not read the way it looks.
