// as handing over the machine. The catalogue is the teaching layer for the

// and says, before the rule is added, that this one belongs behind a private
// source rather than open to the world.

// It is deliberately short. A list of four hundred IANA assignments is a
// search box with extra steps; this is the set a single-server operator
// actually opens, plus the set they open by accident and regret.
