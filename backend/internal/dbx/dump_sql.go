// ClickHouse's is a separate package, SQL Server's ships only inside Microsoft's
// own image, Oracle's runs on the *server* rather than the client, and Redis has
// none at all. The route taken until now was to report those four as
// "unsupported database driver", which is the dashboard telling the operator
// that the backup button on the connection they are looking at was never going
// to work — after they pressed it.
//
// So the dump is written here instead, over the connection the dashboard already
// has. Every engine gets a working backup, and the two that do have a native
// tool (Postgres, MySQL) still use it, because a custom-format pg_dump restores
// faster and more faithfully than any SQL text can. This is the floor, not the
// preference.
//
// The output is ordinary SQL — DDL followed by INSERTs — because that is what a
// dump means to the person holding the file. They can read it, grep it, and feed
// it to a client that is not this one.
