// This is the same binary as the dashboard, started with -self-update, and it
// runs with no configuration at all: no master key, no database, no
// environment inherited from the process that launched it. Everything it needs
// is in the record the backend wrote before creating it — which is the point,
// because that record is also what the operator reads afterwards, so the job
// that was described is exactly the job that ran.
//
// Nothing here talks to a browser. The transcript on disk is the whole
// interface, because the process that would have served it is one of the ones
// being restarted.

// containers have been recreated. A cold start on a small VPS is seconds; five
// minutes covers a machine that is also busy building.
