// Installing an update, from inside one of the things being replaced.
//
// This is the awkward part, and it is worth being explicit about why the
// obvious implementation cannot work. `docker compose up -d --build` on this
// stack rebuilds three images and then recreates three containers, one of
// which is the process that ran the command. Whatever launched it dies
// somewhere in the middle: as a child of the backend it is killed with the
// backend's cgroup, and the frontend and the proxy are then never recreated —
// leaving a half-upgraded install and a dashboard that cannot report what
// happened to it, which is the worst possible outcome for a feature whose
// whole job is to be trustworthy.
//
// So the backend does not run the upgrade. It starts a **sibling container**
// that does — a separate container created through the Docker socket, not a
// child process — and that container is untouched by its own stack being torn
// down and rebuilt around it. It writes its progress to a file in the data
// directory, which both halves mount, so the new backend can pick the story up
// where the old one left off. This is the same trick Watchtower uses to
// replace the container it is running in, for the same reason.
//
// The image the sibling runs is this dashboard's own backend image. It already
// contains git, the docker CLI and the compose plugin — nothing to pull,
// nothing extra to keep current, and an upgrade that still works on a server
// that cannot reach a registry.

// UpdaterContainer is the fixed name of the sibling. Fixed rather than
// generated so that a backend which has just been restarted into a new version
// can find the container that put it there.
