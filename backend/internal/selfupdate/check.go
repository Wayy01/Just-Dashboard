// Asking the repository what the newest version is.
//
// This is the one place the dashboard talks to the internet on its own
// initiative, which is worth being deliberate about: it is a root-equivalent
// panel that most people run down a tunnel precisely so it touches nothing.
// So the request is a single unauthenticated GET of one small file, it carries
// nothing about the install but a version number in the user agent, it happens
// four times a day rather than on every page load, and JD_UPDATE_CHECK=false
// turns it off completely — with the changelog for the installed version
// still readable, because that half is compiled in and needs no network.
//
// raw.githubusercontent.com rather than the releases API, for the reason
// ManifestPath gives: a release becomes a commit rather than a commit plus a
// tag plus a release object, so there is no second step to forget. It is also
// unauthenticated and generously rate-limited, where the API is neither.
