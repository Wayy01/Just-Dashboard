// Which database routes ask for a typed phrase, and — just as importantly —
// which do not.
//
// Invariant 3 reserves the typed phrase for the rare and unrecoverable, on the
// grounds that a phrase in front of an everyday act is typed rather than read.
// That line is a product decision and it has two failure modes, so both are
// pinned here. Losing a phrase from a route that needs one is the obvious one.
// The other is quieter and is how the line got crossed in the first place: a
// phrase creeping back onto a routine action, one route at a time, each
// defensible on its own, until an operator has learned to type table names
// without looking at them.
//
// Both lists are written out by hand. A test deriving either from the router
// would pass just as happily if a route moved between them.
