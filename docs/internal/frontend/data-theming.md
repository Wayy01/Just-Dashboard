# Frontend data flow and theming

- `src/lib/api.ts` is the only fetch layer: `get/post/put/patch/del`, `credentials: "include"`,
  `X-JD-CSRF` on every mutation, `X-Confirm` passthrough, `ApiError` with
  `needsConfirmation`/`isAuthProblem`/`needsTotp`; `wsUrl()` and
  `downloadUrl()` build the non-JSON URLs.
- `usePoll` — abort-per-run so a slow endpoint cannot stack requests, paused on a hidden tab.
- `useSocket` — reconnect with backoff (these sockets ride a tunnel that drops routinely), handlers in a
  ref so a fresh closure does not rebuild the socket.
- `useMetricsWindow` — the charts' window as a **stack**: zooming is exploratory, so the way out of five
  minutes is the hour it was inside, not the day you started from. Deliberately component state — a named
  range is a standing choice, a zoom is a question being asked now, and restoring yesterday's zoom shows an
  empty window with no obvious way out. `useMetricEvents`/`useHealth` poll on much slower cadences.
- `src/lib/types.ts` mirrors the backend's JSON by hand, including the `Capability` union — it drifts if
  backend types change without it. `useAuth`'s `can("capability")` hides controls a role cannot use:
  **affordance only**, the server re-decides every request.
- `ConfirmDialog` collects the typed phrase and the server re-checks it. Its `phrase` is optional and the
  absence is meaningful: a request without one is reversible but still deserves a pause (deleting a
  terminal folder loses a grouping and nothing else), and asking somebody to type "delete folder" teaches
  them to type phrases without reading — the one habit the typed confirmation exists to prevent.
- `lib/metrics-store.ts` keeps the live series **outside React**: owning five minutes of history in a route
  component threw it away on navigation, and pushing a 2 s frame through a context above the router
  re-rendered the terminal and log tail twice a second. Mirrored to sessionStorage so a reload keeps its
  chart, with points older than `STALE_MS` dropped on the way back in — a graph silently stitching this
  minute onto one from an hour ago is worse than one that starts empty.
- `lib/metrics-range.ts` defines the windows (`live`, `1h`, `6h`, `24h`, `7d`), their buckets and cadence,
  and the `MetricsWindow` a dragged span becomes (fixed in the past, fetched once, never re-polled).
  **Live and recorded data are never spliced into one line** — the cadences differ by two orders of
  magnitude, and a chart drawing twenty coarse points and a hundred fine ones at equal spacing lies about
  when things happened. Container charts offer only recorded ranges. `hooks/use-metrics.ts` and
  `hooks/use-metrics-history.ts` are the React surface over those two.
- `hooks/use-self-update.tsx` is one poll for the whole shell, and its gotcha is the feature's design
  problem: **the API goes away in the middle of the thing it is watching**. A failed poll during a run
  renders as "restarting", never an error, and the cadence is set from the fetch rather than an effect so a
  failure does not drop back to the five-minute interval. `components/update/` is the sidebar-footer notice
  (which renders *nothing* when there is nothing to say), the release-notes sheet, and the panel on
  `/dashboard` — that page is the dashboard's own version and nothing else, because the server's packages
  and the tool you look at it through are updated by completely different machinery.
- `hooks/use-self-config.tsx` is the same shape for the dashboard's own settings, with one problem the
  update flow does not have: a change to the port or the address means the dashboard **does not come back
  here**. Nothing on the client can follow it, so the run record carries the new endpoint and
  `components/config/restart-progress.tsx` states it as a URL to open rather than spinning on an address
  that is now answering nothing. It also renders a fourth outcome — `rolled_back`, the configuration that
  did not come up and was undone — because showing that as either success or failure would misreport it.
  The form on `/dashboard/configuration` **derives** its draft from the poll rather than mirroring it into
  state: a copy refreshed every two seconds would wipe half-typed input during a restart.
- **Theming is light and dark, one palette**, in `globals.css`'s `:root` and `.dark`. `lib/themes.ts` holds
  only what does not belong in a component: `ThemeMode`, `DEFAULT_MODE` (dark), the storage key, and
  `themeBootstrapScript()`. That script is inlined in `<head>` so the stored choice applies **before first
  paint**, with the request's CSP nonce — reading it after hydration flashes a screen of near-black at
  anyone who chose light, on every navigation that reloads the document; `<html>` carries
  `suppressHydrationWarning` for exactly that.
  `hooks/use-theme.tsx` treats the document as the store (`useSyncExternalStore` over the root class)
  rather than holding a second copy to sync in an effect. The choice is in localStorage, not on the
  account: it belongs to the screen you are sitting at. `/appearance` is the page; ⌘K is the shortcut.
