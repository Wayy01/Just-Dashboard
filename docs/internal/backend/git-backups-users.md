# Git, backups, and host users

## Git working copies

`internal/gitx` discovers repositories at most five levels below `JD_GIT_ROOTS`, skips generated and
hidden trees, and stops descending once it finds `.git`. `Resolve` cleans and symlink-resolves every
repository path, checks the configured roots, and verifies either a normal `.git` directory or worktree
file. Remote URLs are scrubbed before they are returned because credentials embedded in HTTPS remotes
must not reach the list page.

The read surface reports repository summary/status, commit history, local and remote branches, diffs, and
a bounded topological graph whose lane layout spans branches and tags. The terminal uses `/git/detect` to
find the checkout containing its current directory while keeping “not a repository” and “outside the
configured roots” as honest non-error states.

All Git subprocesses receive explicit argv and run as the checkout owner through `hostexec.AsOwner`, so a
web operation does not leave root-owned files. Refs reject leading dashes, traversal-like `..`, invalid
characters, and `.lock` suffixes; file arguments reject absolute/traversing/option-shaped values and follow
an explicit `--`. Pull is fast-forward-only, push never forces and establishes a missing upstream, checkout
never forces, branch deletion defaults to Git's merged-only mode, and stash includes untracked files.

Route capabilities reflect recoverability: reads require `read`; fetch/pull/push/checkout/branch/stash,
stage/unstage/commit require `service.control`; discard, reset, and branch deletion pass through
`s.destructive`. Discard and hard reset require typed confirmation because they overwrite uncommitted work;
branch deletion uses ordinary confirmation because Git preserves the commits in reflogs/remotes. GitHub
authentication and pull requests are detailed in
[`processes-terminal-github.md`](processes-terminal-github.md#github-sign-in).

## Backups

`internal/backups` stores job definitions and run history in SQLite. A job has source paths, exclusion
globs, a local/S3/Backblaze-B2 destination, a five-field cron schedule, an enabled flag, and a retention
count. Displayable target configuration is separate from access keys; credentials are sealed by
`auth.Sealer` and never returned by the API. The target-test route checks local writability or object-store
bucket access before the operator depends on a schedule.

`Scheduler` rebuilds its in-memory robfig/cron entries from enabled jobs at start and after edits. Manual
and scheduled runs share `Runner.Execute`; a per-job running set prevents overlap. Execution records a run,
streams a gzip-compressed tar archive to a `0600` staging file, skips unreadable entries with transcript
evidence, applies exclusions to both full paths and basenames, then moves locally or uploads through the
AWS S3 multipart client. B2 uses the same client with its endpoint and path-style addressing. Run logs are
bounded before persistence.

Retention deletes the oldest successful artifacts and their run rows, but skips an artifact while archive
listing or restore holds a read reference. Cross-device local moves fall back from rename to copy. Deleting
a job deliberately leaves its existing artifacts alone.

Archive listing is bounded and does not extract. Restore requires a successful artifact, downloads remote
objects into private staging, refuses `/`, and is typed-confirmed with the destination. The API resolves the
destination through `files.Resolve`; extraction uses `safepath` for every directory, regular file, and
symlink, refusing traversal and unsafe link targets. Backup-before-deploy behavior and restore-evidence
limits are covered in [`../deployments/implementation.md`](../deployments/implementation.md).

## Host users and SSH keys

`internal/linuxusers` manages local operating-system accounts, not dashboard identities. The entire
`/system-users` route tree requires `system.admin`, including reads, because it exposes shells, groups,
login history, lock state, and SSH-key counts. Account state is assembled from the mounted host
`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/shadow`, `lastlog`, and each home directory's `authorized_keys`; system
accounts are hidden by default in the UI.

Usernames and group names follow a closed 32-character Unix pattern. New accounts are created with a
locked password, so access must be added deliberately with a public key; shells must be absolute, comments
cannot inject passwd fields, and the group picker comes from the host group database. A protected-account
set cannot be deleted or locked. Account deletion is destructive and typed with the username, especially
because it may remove the home directory; key removal is destructive but ordinarily confirmed.

SSH public keys are parsed with `x/crypto/ssh`, reject private/multi-line input, expose SHA-256 fingerprints,
and de-duplicate by fingerprint. `.ssh` and `authorized_keys` are repaired to owner-only `0700`/`0600`
permissions and host ownership. Removal matches a fingerprint and atomically replaces the file, so a stale
line number cannot remove a different key.

The current host-execution implementation and its relationship to the documented invariant are recorded in
[`../reference/verification-findings.md`](../reference/verification-findings.md).
