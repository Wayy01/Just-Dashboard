# Repository map

This is the coverage checklist for the codebase-level guides. It maps every maintained source area to its
owner and detailed internal document; source files remain authoritative for exported APIs and individual
fields.

## Root, build, and operations

| Area | Responsibility | Detailed reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.yml`, `deploy/Caddyfile`, `deploy/proxy-entrypoint.sh` | Single-host production topology, loopback-only services, the Caddy listener and its three TLS modes, mounts, and health checks | [`../deployments/implementation.md`](../deployments/implementation.md#deployment-topology) |
| `install.sh`, `.env.example` | Installation: two reachability routes (Tailscale, SSH tunnel), certificate issuance, randomised internal ports, secrets, and operator configuration | [`../overview.md`](../overview.md), public [`../../../README.md`](../../../README.md) |
| `scripts/release.sh`, `backend/scripts/` | Version update, generated changelog, build verification, and release commit preparation | [`../backend/databases-proxy-platform.md`](../backend/databases-proxy-platform.md#cutting-a-release) |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Mandatory contributor workflow, security baseline, licensing, and full validation gate | [`../contributing/conventions.md`](../contributing/conventions.md) |

## Backend entry point and packages

`backend/cmd/server` loads configuration, opens the store, creates the API server, starts background
services, handles signals, and supports the isolated self-update worker mode. The 29 packages under
`backend/internal/` are:

## Updating this map

Add a row when a new backend package, frontend source area, root executable, or operational subsystem is
introduced. Update the linked detailed guide in the same change; a map entry alone is not implementation
documentation.
